# courses-and-stuff (readme wip)

Welcome to my personal workbench, this is a place where you will find the stuff I develop within courses, workshops, bootcamps, events, challenges or anything that fits in the same idea.

It might seem a little messy just like most of workbench rooms, but it is like I can find myself in the mess. Most of my creations will migrate from here to a special repository, and it means I got my personal touch to it and it is worth sharing.

To help you getting through and everything and understand a little more about what's going on here, there is guide below.
