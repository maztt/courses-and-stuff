# courses-and-stuff

<p align="justify">Welcome to my personal workbench, this is a place where you will find the stuff I develop within courses, workshops, bootcamps, events, challenges or anything that fits in that same idea.</p>

<p align="justify">I thought about doing this way once I'm consistently learning things. I basically had to have a place where I could keep things so I don't have to create multiple repositories.</p>

<p align="justify">I guess most of the content here will migrate from here to a special repository, and once it happens it means I improved things and got my personal touch to it and it is worth sharing.</p>
