# courses-and-stuff

<p align="justify">Welcome to my personal workbench. This is a place where you can find the projects I've developed in courses, workshops, bootcamps, events, challenges, or anything that fits within that same idea.</p>

<p align="justify">I decided to create this space because I am always learning new things and I needed a place to keep everything together, without having to create multiple repositories.</p>

<p align="justify">Most of the content here will eventually migrate to a special repository. Once this happens, it means that I have improved the project and added my personal touch to it, making it worth sharing.</p>
