# courses-and-stuff (readme wip)

<p align="justify">Welcome to my personal workbench, this is a place where you will find the stuff I develop within courses, workshops, bootcamps, events, challenges or anything that fits in the same idea.</p>

<p align="justify">I know it might seem a little messy just like some workbench rooms, but I thought about doing this way once I'm used to study most of the time. So I basically had to have a place where I could keep things so I don't have to create multiple repositories.</p>

<p align="justify">I guess most of my creations will migrate from here to a special repository, and once it happens it means I got my personal touch to it and it is worth sharing.</p>

<p align="justify">To help you getting through everything and understand a little more about what's going on here, there is guide below.</p>
